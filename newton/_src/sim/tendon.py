"""Tendon system for cable-driven mechanisms.

Implements massless cable routing through rigid body contact points (pulleys,
pinholes, attachments) using the Cable Joints method [Müller et al. SCA 2018].

Each tendon is an ordered sequence of waypoints on rigid bodies. Between
adjacent waypoints, a unilateral distance constraint enforces the cable
length. Rolling links use the Cable Joints tangent update and can apply finite
capstan slip through their ``mu`` value; high ``mu`` recovers the no-slip
baseline. Pinholes are zero-radius waypoints on a rigid body and transfer rest
length between their adjacent spans subject to the same local capstan tension
ratio. ``mu=0`` gives a frictionless pinhole, while higher ``mu`` increasingly
resists slip through the point.
